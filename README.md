# Spotify-Re-Wrappeed

The Spotify wrapped feature is one of my favorite playlists Spotify has to offer. And while it certainly is special to revisit the songs and artists that connected with me the most at the end of every year, I geek out over music statistics. Espeically my own. So I decided to create a Spotify wrapped (re-wrapped!) to track my most listened songs continously throughout the year.
